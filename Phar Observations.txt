According to a study on mice, the size of tumors was smallest when treated with Capomulin and **Ramicane*drugs. These two drugs also had the most treatments during the designated time period. On the other hand, the tumors were largest when mice were treated with Ketapril and Naftisol drugs. Although these two drugs had the next greatest number of treatments, the mice still had the largest tumors after treatment.

The study also found that there was a negligible difference between the genders of mice in the study, with a ratio of 50.4% female and 49.6% male.

I hope this helps!
